Here are some brief instructions on how to get running with SWAMP.

= Introduction =

SWAMP is a simple system, with simple requirements, but may not be
obvious to install, especially since no installation wizard has been
developed.  Here is a brief look at how to install. 

== Quick Benefits and Consequences ==
Offering a SWAMP service has a important benefits to those publishing
their data: 
 * Drastically reduced bandwidth demand from the server.
 * Simple, familiar analysis through scripts of NCO.  No new language
 learning needed! 
 * Efficient analysis execution. SWAMP parallelizes your script so you
 get your results faster... automatically. 

However, there are a few issues that you may be aware of, as the
server administrator: 
 * Increased CPU load at the server.  Since SWAMP relocates analysis
 away from the user and towards the server, where the data resides,
 some amount of CPU load increase should be expected.   
 * SWAMP does not authentication for use.  Until such a feature is
 added, you may wish to keep your SWAMP instance behind a firewall.
 The worst danger is that a demanding script may take a long time to
 execute, and cause the request queue to be lengthy.  SWAMP is
 conservatively designed to never overload the server.  If your data
 is sensitive, a firewall is a must.   
 * Disks hosting your data may be used more intensively.  Except for
 odd cases, this means your data is getting more usage, which is
 positive.  SWAMP enhances access to your data, and like other forms
 of access, can increase load. 


= Before getting started =
Make sure your system meets the requirements:
  * Unix-like operating system with installed software: 
    * [http://python.org Python] 2.4 or higher
    * Twisted Web (0.5 or higher) [http://twistedmatrix.com/ Twisted
    Matrix Labs] 
    * [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26590&package_id=18246 SOAPpy], from the [http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/ Python Web Services Project], and its dependency, [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/fpconst/0.7.2 fpconst] 
    * [http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com pyparsing]
    * [http://nco.sourceforge.net netCDF Operators ]

Most modern Linux distributions should have all of these in their
repositories, and all are otherwise installable from installers or
source packages^1^.  It _may_ be possible to make things work on a
Windows platform.  Let us know if you'd like to try. 
  
= Step 1: Download SWAMP service =
Although you can install using SVN, it's probably simpler to just get
the swamp-service package and use it.   
(coming soon)

Once you've downloaded it, go ahead and unpack it into your directory
of choice. 

= Step 2: Configure SWAMP (edit swamp.conf) =
Copy the included sample-swamp.conf over to swamp.conf and edit it
appropriately.  The file is annotated with brief descriptions of each
option, but please ask if any help is needed. 

= Step 3: Start SWAMP =
You may now start SWAMP with the commandline: {{{python
swamp_soapinterface.py}}}  If your python installation is elsewhere,
replace {{{python}}} with whatever is appropriate, e.g. {{{python24}}}
on Rocks 4.2 .

== Notes ==
^1^ Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu have all of them in their package
repositories (though Debian and older Ubuntu dists use old versions of
NCO).  RHEL/CentOS coverage may be spotty-- please post to the forums
if you would like to try our homebuilt RPMs for these platforms.
