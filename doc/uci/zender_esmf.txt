Your data mirror at the pbs cluster SWAMP instance
--------------------------------------------------

The pbs cluster has been set to automatically keep a copy of your 
/data/<userid> directory on the ESMF.  Every two hours, it will
connect to the ESMF and pull new updates.  

Of course, in the interests of saving space, you may wish to exclude
certain directories from being updated.  To do this, place a file
named '.swamp-filter' in the directory you wish excluded, with one
line containing '- *'.  In other words, do: 

# change to directory you want excluded:
esmf04m$ cd /data/myname/uselessfiles
esmf04m$ cat >.swamp-filter
- *
^D
esmf04m$ cat .swamp-filter
- *
esmf04m$

In this example, we first switch to the directory to be excluded ("cd
/data/myname/uselessfiles").  Then, we use 'cat' and a shell pipe to
create '.swamp-filter' ("cat >.swamp-filter").  We type '- *' and then
hit enter and control-d to end the file.  We can verify the contents
of .swamp-filter afterwards ("cat .swamp-filter").  Feel free to use
your favorite editor to create the file if you prefer (emacs, vi,
nano, pico, gedit, kate, etc.). 

The .swamp-filter file(s) will take effect at the next update interval.

Let me know if you have any questions.
